# 👋 Hi, I'm Siddeshwar Vasam

🚀 Backend Developer | 🧠 System Design Learner | 💼 Open to Opportunities

I'm a results-driven backend engineer with **~2 years of experience** building scalable, modular, and production-ready microservices using **Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Docker**. I love designing clean REST APIs, optimizing SQL queries, and leveraging multithreading and **design patterns** to make systems faster, reliable, and maintainable.

Skilled in applying key **Object-Oriented Principles (OOP)** and **Design Patterns** like **Strategy**, **Singleton**, **Repository**, and **Factory** to build reusable, scalable, and testable backend systems.

## 🛠️ Projects

### ⚕️ [Healthcare Microservices System](https://github.com/siddeshwarv/patient-managment)  
*A robust backend system with 5 microservices (Patient, Billing, Analytics, Auth, Gateway) designed using **event-driven architecture** and clean **microservices principles***  
- 🔗 Tech: Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, Docker, JWT, PostgreSQL  
- 🧩 Applied **modular design** with proper separation of concerns  
- 📬 Implemented **asynchronous communication** using Kafka  
- 🔐 Secured endpoints using JWT and Spring Security  
- 🧠 Employed **Factory Pattern** for service creation and **Strategy Pattern** for request handling logic

### 🛒 [Flipkart Daily – Inventory Management System](https://github.com/siddeshwarv/flipkart-daily-inventory-system)  
*A clean Spring Boot architecture simulating a real-world inventory backend system*  
- ⚙️ Structured using **Repository**, **Singleton**, and **Strategy Design Patterns**  
- 🔍 Includes advanced filtering, search logic, and modular layers (Controller → Service → DAO)  
- 🚀 Built as a base to demonstrate Spring Boot fundamentals, ideal for future DB integration
